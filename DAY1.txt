1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP/1.1
 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, 
it blocks all the other resources behind it. In contrast, 
HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of 
data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building
blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s 
primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the 
sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
